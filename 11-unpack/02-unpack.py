full_name = ['Sport', 'Club', 'Corinthians', 'Paulista']


# The same idea:

# Idea 1:
slice1, slice2, slice3, slice4 = full_name
print(slice1, slice2, slice3, slice4)


# Idea 2:
print(*full_name)


# Obviously, we don't have the variables, but we extract values from our
# list equivalent to that on line 8.
