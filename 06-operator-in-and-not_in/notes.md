# Notes

**Strings in Python are iterable, which means you can iterate over each character in the string using a loop or other iterable-related operations like list comprehensions.**

~~~python
    teamName = "CORINTHIANS"
    print(teamName[3])

    """
        output

        I
    """
~~~

So we can...


~~~python
    teamName = "CORINTHIANS"


    print('Z' in teamName)
    print('C' in teamName)
    print("D" not in teamName)


    """
        output

        True
        False
        True
    """
~~~
