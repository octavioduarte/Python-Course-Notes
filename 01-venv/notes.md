# Notes

~~~bash
    python3 -m venv venv
~~~

**The flag `-m` indicates that we will execute a Python library as a script.**
<br/>

**`venv` is a Python library used to create virtual environments.**
<br/>

**The second occurrence of venv is the name of the virtual environment we are creating.**


This command generates this structure: 

<img src="./images//venv-folders.png" alt="images generated by venv">

<br/>

This command activates our virtual environment:

~~~bash
    source venv/bin/activate
~~~

<br/>

This command kills our virtual environment:

~~~bash
    deactivate
~~~
